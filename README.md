### Problem Statement
Thyroid disease is one of the most common disease with endocrine disorder in the human population today. For example hyperthyroidism (over) and hypothyroidism (under), which are relate to release of amount of thyroid hormones the thyroid gland produces and whether it is over active trusted source (when thyroid gland makes too much thyroid hormone) or under active trusted source (when the thyroid gland doesnâ€™t make enough thyroid hormone). We need to identify whether the patient has thyroid or not.

### Solution Proposed 
We need to build a ML model which will be used by hospitals and help the hospital authority to identify if the patient has thyroid or not. If it is a positive case then medical will do further test to know what type of thyroid the person is suffering from and according to that the treatment will be on fast-track. The doctors will start treating the patients. If the result will come negative then the patient will be sent to a junior doctor and the junior doctors by using their own expertise they will decide that if the model has done correct prediction or not. If analysis comes true then the doctor release the patient. By seeing the readings if doctor analysed that there may be a chance of thyroid then patient sent to the senior doctors. 

## Tech Stack Used
1. Python 
2. VS Code 
3. Machine learning algorithms
4. Docker
5. MongoDB
6. Flask

## Infrastructure Required.

1. AWS S3
2. AWS EC2
3. AWS ECR
4. Github Actions
5. Airflow
6. AWS Elastic Beanstalk

## How to run?
Before we run the project, make sure that you are having MongoDB in your local system, with Compass since we are using MongoDB for data storage. You also need AWS account to access the service like S3, ECR and EC2 instances.

For real-time prediction you can use the above Elastic Beanstalk link
